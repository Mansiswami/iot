This is a project that I did as part of the "Internet of Things" course in my 5th semester during undergrad.

1.)Hardware used: NodeMCU,Gas sensors (MQ-2)

2.)IDE used: Arduino IDE 1.8.5

The objective of this project is to construct an Indoor air quality monitoring system for detecting toxic gases.
